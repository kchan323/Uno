Some of our helper functions with specifications, “used for testing purposes,” 
were used extensively to help us debug our code and make sure everything was 
working. We checked with our TA who confirmed that these functions are not 
considered “dead code.” Some test cases may seem unnecessary or repetitive, but 
these were added to test different cases and increase the bisect score for 
helper functions that were not made public in the .mli files.
