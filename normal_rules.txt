Here are the rules for the normal version of our UNO game! 
  ‚ñ∂ UNO can be played with 2-4 players who will take turns on one terminal. üíª 
    ‚ñ∂ Please enter usernames that are one word (no spaces and unique). 
  ‚ñ∂ Most rules are similar to the UNO card game with some additional rules below!
    ‚ñ∂ If [player1] drops a Draw2 or WildcardDraw4 on [player2], those cards will be added to [player2]'s hand but [player2] will still have a turn. 
    ‚ñ∂ Special cards can not be stacked! Dropping a Draw2 on top of another Draw2 does NOT mean the next player will get +4 cards. 
    ‚ñ∂ For 2 player games, using a Skip card will let the current player play again.
    ‚ñ∂ Each player starts with 7 random card and can win by being the first player to get rid of all your cards ü§©!
    ‚ñ∂ If no one wins after 50 cards have been drawn, the game will end ‚åõÔ∏è.
  
  ‚ñ∂ At your turn, you can enter one of these (non case sensitive) commands:
    ‚ñ∂ drop [card]:     drop any card that matches the color, number or special action of the top card. This card will be removed from your hand.
                       The card has to be written using the full name and not the abbreviation.
                       Ex: drop Blue 3, drop wildcarddraw4

    ‚ñ∂ draw:            a random card will be added to your hand and if it matches the top card, you are able to drop it in the same turn.

    ‚ñ∂ dropuno [card]:  when you are about to drop your second to last card, you can use this to call "UNO!" and then drop your card. 
                       if you do not call "UNO!", then other players can call uno on you and a card will be added to your hand.
                       Ex: dropuno Red 3

    ‚ñ∂ uno_on [player]: call this on a [player] who has one card left but hasn't called uno to add a card to their deck and then finish making your move. 
                       Ex: uno_on Ein
    
    ‚ñ∂ quit: ends the game for everyone
